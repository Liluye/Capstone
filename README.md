# The Adventures of Baldric
Our group's project will be a game created using the Unity game engine. The game will be a top-down 2D asynchronous maze/puzzle-like game. It will allow players to exchange hints on how to complete the maze or puzzle and share items with other players. We will start by creating one level with the ability to share hints in the form of notes around the level. Once we establish that core functionality, we can add extra features such as enemy sprites, items, and additional levels as time permits. At the beginning of the level we will connect to a database to retrieve a selection of hints and items left from other players. At the end of the level we will allow the player to leave hints and items behind. Each level will have traps and puzzles that impede a player's progress, the social aspect of the hints can also be a help or a hindrance depending on whether the previous players are trying to assist or plant false information.
